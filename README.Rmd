## Purpose

The goal of `maccaindex` package is to provide functions for visualizations and
analysis of The Economist's Big Mac Index. We aim to spark the fire of learning economic theories through visual mediums. The package
includes the original dataset for the user to play with, a customization
plotting function, a numerical function to deal with multiple types of
vectors, and a Shiny app that allow users to explore and understand the
Big Mac Index data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of maccaindex from [GitHub](https://github.com/ETC5523-2023/rpkg-KhanhPham3838) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ETC5523-2023/rpkg-KhanhPham3838")
```

## Overview

`maccaindex` consists of the following functions:

* `macca_raw` results in the Big Mac Index raw data.
* `maccapp()` runs the accompanied Big Mac Index visualization R Shiny app.
* `macca_inflation_plot()` plots the inflation rate of different countries based on Big Mac prices, in local or US prices depending on the user.
* `magicwand_df()` invokes the various results that can be used to aid data analysis for a variety of data types. 

## Usage

```{r}
library(maccaindex)

data("macca_raw", package = "maccaindex")
macca_raw

# Single argument functionality for numerical vector
vectorx <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
result <- magicwand_df(vectorx)
print(result)

# Two-argument functionality for numerical and character/factor vectors
vectorx <- c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1)
vectory <- c("apple", "banana", "apple", "banana", "banana")
result <- magicwand_df(vectorx, vectory)
print(result)

# Interactive plot ()
# macca_inflation_plot("US")

# The app is not ran in example as it would hinder render process
# maccapp()
```
